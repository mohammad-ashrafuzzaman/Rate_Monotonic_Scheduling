@book{tanenbaum2009modern,
  title={Modern operating systems},
  author={Tanenbaum, Andrew},
  year={2009},
  note={This book discusses operating systems, computer architecture, and more general topics. It was instrumental as a reference for the explanation of dynamic scheduling applications without real-time requirements, providing foundational knowledge on operating system concepts and structures which were applied in the context of scheduling algorithms.},
